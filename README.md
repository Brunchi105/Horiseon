# Horiseon Code Refactor

**Version 1.0.0**

Applied the Scout Rule. Modified the code of Horiseon's webpage in order to make it more accessible. Cleaned the existing stylesheet and edited the HTML file accordingly. The [index.html] file now has semantic elements and alt attributes within the image elements. 

Web accessibility is important because it enables people with disabilities to access websites using assistive technologies. It also improves search engine optimization and helps avoid litigation.
